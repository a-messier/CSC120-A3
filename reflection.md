I worked with Lucy on the assignment. We met up on Monday to go over how we had structured our code, and work through any bugs we may have had. We had very different methods of approaching how to do the assignment, mostly pertaining to how to catch keywords. I tried to write the code in a way that could be easilly altered, which ended up being pretty difficult and coming with some unanticipated issues. In my code, to add new keywords,one would just need to add a key/value pair to the HashMap. Lucy opted to include multiple if statements to check for each keyword, which I debated doing but decided my method was fundamentally the same. 

I unfortunatly was not able to attend any office hours/TA sessions (extremly busy week for senior research thesis things), but I felt like I had a strong enough grasp on the assignment to justify not going. I feel a little shakey on some of the topics from this week I anticipate seeing on the next homework, so I know I will attend hours in the future. 

Initially, Java felt really uncomfortable. I have a strong Python background (and not at all in using classes), so the idea that everything in Java has to be in a class did not fully sink in before doing this assignment. I had a hard time grasping what sorts of variables should be class attributes and which I could just have as local variables. Since I have had to learn and apply many different Python packages in the past, I am pretty comfortable with looking up and implementing code, so teaching myself a lot of the syntax wasn't too difficult. I feel like I caught on much quicker than I had expected to to Java syntax. 

From using both Python and Java, I can conclude that the most important part of programming is being able to verbalize what you want to do. The actual execution can be researched, but going into an assignment with a plan (psuedocode) is really important to understanding what code you are writing. I benefit from commenting on every line to make sure each line is relevent and producive to my program. 

In my assignment, I found that it was much harder than I thought to replace keywords. I kept accidently replacing things cyclically, for example my -> your and then you -> I would yeild "Ir". I had to find a way to make sure the bot did not replace words it already had. I did so by capitalizing the entire string and then searching for uppercase words, and replacing them with lowercase words. This works, but does not preserve the case of the user's input. I would love to find a work-around for this, but did not have the bandwidth this week to do so. 

For someone taking this class in the future - I would reccomend finding a friend to bounce ideas off in the class, as well as getting practice teaching yourself syntax online!
